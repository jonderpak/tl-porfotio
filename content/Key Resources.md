She discusses how good intentions can sometimes be misinterpreted if not clearly communicated and offers strategies to ensure that advocacy is constructive, student-centered, and relationship-driven. | Kelsye Baudoin advocates for teacher-librarians to:<br><br>- Be **visible** and **transparent** in their daily practices.<br>    <br>- Share their purpose and impact with their school community clearly and often.<br>    <br>- Frame advocacy not as self-promotion, but as supporting student learning and equity.<br>    <br>AASL, the publisher of the podcast, supports school librarians as instructional leaders and partners in education. Their mission is to **empower school librarians** to transform teaching and learning by integrating literacy, research, and digital skills. | - **Effective Advocacy** means:<br>    <br>    - Using visual tools (like infographics or newsletters) to communicate impact.<br>        <br>    - Framing your work through a **student-centered lens**.<br>        <br>    - Consistently showing—not just telling—what happens in the library.<br>        <br>- **Ineffective Advocacy** includes:<br>    <br>    - Complaining about being misunderstood without offering clarity.<br>        <br>    - Remaining silent in moments that require leadership or explanation.<br>        <br>    - Letting frustration cloud professional communication.<br>        <br>- Kelsye emphasizes the idea that intentions must be matched by explanation, people can't support what they don't understand. | - **AASL’s Learning Leaders Report**<br>    <br>    - Offers tools and frameworks for advocacy aligned with school leadership.<br>        <br>- https://www.ala.org/aasl/advocacy/tools/learning-leaders<br>        <br>- **Future Ready Librarians Framework**<br>    <br>    - Highlights areas where TLs lead, including data use, curation, and collaborative leadership.<br>        <br>    - https://futureready.org/program-overview/librarians/<br>        <br>- **AASL Position Statements & Advocacy Guides**<br>    <br>    - Offers templates, success stories, and strategies for communication with administrators and stakeholders.<br>- https://www.ala.org/aasl/advocacy |
